Simple to use profile plugin allowing front-end login, user registration and edit profile by using shortcodes.
 
== Description ==

**Profile Builder is WordPress user registration done right.**

It lets you customize your website by adding a front-end menu for all your users, 
giving them a more flexible way to modify their user profile or register new users (front-end user registration). 
Also, grants users with administrator rights to customize basic user fields or add custom user fields. 

To achieve this, just create a new page and give it an intuitive name(i.e. Edit Profile).
Now all you need to do is add the following shortcode(for the previous example): [wppb-edit-profile]. 
Publish the page and you are done!

= Front-end User Registration, Login, Edit Profile and Password Recovery Shortcodes =
You can use the following shortcode list:

* **[wppb-edit-profile]** - to grant users front-end access to their profile (requires user to be logged in).
* **[wppb-login]** - to add a front-end login form.
* **[wppb-register]** - to add a front-end user registration form.
* **[wppb-recover-password]** - to add a password recovery form.

Users with administrator rights have access to the following features:

* add a custom stylesheet/inherit values from the current theme or use one of the following built into this plugin: default, white or black.
* select whether to display or not the admin bar in the front-end for a specific user group registered to the site.

1. Upload the profile-builder folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create a new page and use one of the shortcodes available. Publish the page and you're done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I navigated away from Profile Builder and now I can’t find it anymore; where is it? =
	
	Profile Builder can be found in the default menu of your WordPress installation under the “Users” sub-menu.

= Why do the custom WordPress user fields still show up, even though I set it to be "hidden"? =

	Profile Builder only disables the default user fields in the front-end of your site/blog, it does absolutely nothing in the dashboard.

= I can’t find a question similar to my issue; Where can I find support? =
